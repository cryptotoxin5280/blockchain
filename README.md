### Reference
To learn how blockchain works, I watched John Delaney's Fireship YouTube video, ["Bitcoin in 100 Seconds"](https://youtu.be/qF7dkrce-mQ?si=WjSI5qrYuh_EuvWy) and refactored his [Node implementation](https://github.com/fireship-io/node-blockchain) to Python just to see if I could create a Pythonic blockchain example that was just as simple.
